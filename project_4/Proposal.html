        I am <span class = 'bold'>Ahmadreza Gholizade</span> from Iran. I have a bachelor's degree in Geomatics, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in GIS. I have a career in Graphic Design, which involves bringing my ideas to life and creating visually appealing designs. Now, I am extremely interested in programming and dedicated to practicing it in the most effective way possible. I would be delighted to work with you because I have a strong interest in architecture. Now, I want to choose my WENET and WEBGIS project for my master's degree related to Arel Company.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Research the company:
    </h4>
    <p>
        &nbsp I understand that the main goal of this company is to enhance the quality of design and construction in order to improve the quality of life and the environment for all sectors of society. The Arel Architects group, with the assistance of its highly skilled and experienced design-engineering team, benefits from a wide range of executive and civil facilities that adhere to international standards. Additionally, by localizing knowledge and implementing current architectural models worldwide, they have played a significant role in designing and constructing various commercial, cultural, residential, industrial, administrative, and urban projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp Some notable projects carried out by this company include the design, supervision, and execution of 200 Samsung representative offices in Iran, 300 branches of Bank Melli, the Baharan-e-Naft project, and the design and architecture of an oil company residential complex. In line with their commitment to their goals and ideals, this company has also engaged in various cultural and artistic activities, including participation in popular television programs, organizing photography contests with the theme of "Hope for Life," book publishing, and hosting multiple art exhibitions.    </p>
    </p>
    <h4>
        The partnership opportunity:
    </h4>
    <p>
        &nbsp In this project, we can provide a database. In a database, we can manage the architects and projects that are related to each other. People can submit votes on projects and architects based on aesthetics. These votes are stored in the database. In addition, these votes and other attributes can be displayed in the user interface (UI). Beautiful UI and favorable UX are the main goals of this project.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp The purpose of the project is to introduce these entities to people and advertise them.

    <h4>
        Conclusion:
    </h4>
    <p>
        Having a website for an architectural firm can increase visibility, showcase projects, and attract potential clients. It provides a platform to share expertise and connect with the audience. A well-structured database can help organize project details, client information, and resources efficiently, improving project management and client communication. Gathering votes through a website can help architects understand public opinion on projects and ideas, aiding in decision-making and community engagement.
